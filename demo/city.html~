Picture below is a 3D representation of a simplified city landscape.  A red
ball represents the center of contaminats release.  The scroll bars allow to
position the center of contaminant release and change wind direction.  Mouse
buttons and grag allow to rotate/translate the scene.

<h4>Description of the Applet</h4>

<p>
The purpose of the simulation is to show the possibility of drastically
reducing the time of predicting contamination levels by using pre-processed
results of prior simulations.
</p>

<p>
After selecting an object from "SELECT OBJECT" list and pressing the "Fire"
button, the simulation will start. The count of particle hits on the object
will gradually accumulate in the "Current" field label. However, the
"Predicted" field label will immediately show the corresponding hit count. A
much faster response can be achieved because the predicted hit counts are
retrieved from a database accumulated during preliminary simulations done for
a limited area within the landscape. This area is marked by red
rectangular. If the contamination is released from that area the results can
be retrieved from the database without delay. In the absence of the database
data a much longer time is required to obtain the results, since the full 3D
simulation has to be run.

Picture below is a 3D representation of a simplified city landscape.  A red
ball represents the center of contaminats release.  The scroll bars allow to
position the center of contaminant release and change wind direction.  Mouse
buttons and grag allow to rotate/translate the scene.

<h4>Description of the Applet</h4>

<p>
The purpose of the simulation is to show the possibility of drastically
reducing the time of predicting contamination levels by using pre-processed
results of prior simulations.
</p>

<p>
After selecting an object from "SELECT OBJECT" list and pressing the "Fire"
button, the simulation will start. The current count of particle hits on the
object will show in the "Current" field label. The "Predicted" field label
will immediately show the corresponding hit count obtained in prior
simulations. A much faster response can be achieved because the predicted hit
counts are retrieved from a database and not computed in real time. The
accuracy of the results is determined by the number of particles used in
simulations. The results retrieved from the database have higher accuracy
because they were produced with the greater number of particles, which took
significantly longer time than applet simulation can afford. 
</p>
<p>
Since the whole database of hit counts is too large to be transfered over the
network at once, the data are split into chunks, corresponding to small
areas. The red frame shows the area corresponding to the currently loaded hit
count data.  Repeated release of aerosols from that area does not require
repeated data transfers.
</p>
<p>
The approach enables to significantly reduce the time needed to obtain
results on aerosol fallout, by replacing a full 3D simulation with database
retrieval. This is especially important for express risk assessment in
emergency situations.
